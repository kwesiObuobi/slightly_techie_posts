# Getting Started

## Pre-requisites and Local Development

### Setting up the backend

* Install Dependencies

1. **Python 3.10** - Follow instructions to install the latest version of python 3 for your platform. Visit the [python docs](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Virtual Environment and PIP dependencies** - Virtual envrionements are recommended whenever python is being used for projects. This keeps your dependecies separate and organized for each project. Instructions for setting up a virual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

3. **PIP Dependencies** - Once your virtual environment is setup and running, install the required dependencies by navigating to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
